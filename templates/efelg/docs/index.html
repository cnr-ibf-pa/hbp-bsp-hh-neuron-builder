            <h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
            <p>
                The EBRAINS NeuroFeatureExtract (NFE) is a web application that allows users to extract an ensemble of
                electrophysiological properties from voltage traces recorded upon electrical stimulation of neuronal
                cells (see Fig. 1). The main outcome of the application
                is the generation of two files - <em>features.json</em> and <em>protocols.json</em> - that can be used
                for later model
                parameter optimizations.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                For data selection, there are three possible scenarios:
                1) The user selects voltage traces from the provided dataset;
                2) The user selects the voltage traces from uploaded data files (through the “Upload” utility of the
                GUI);
                3) The user selects traces
                from both the dataset and her/his own uploaded file(s).
                <br> This application leverages the Electrophys Feature Extract Library (<span
                    class="text-primary">eFEL</span>) and the
                <a href="https://bluepyefe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">
                    BluePyEfe</a>
                software packages and provides a friendly interfaceto select voltage traces (individually or
                collectively,
                based on the applied stimulus
                current) and features to be extracted.

            <br>
            <h4><strong>Electrophysiological data</strong></h4>
            <p>
                The NFE can only be used for voltage traces recorded or simulated during a step current stimulation
                protocol. The files uploaded by the users must fulfil this requirement. Below we report a brief
                description of the data formats currently in use.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5><strong>Dataset</strong></h5>
            <p>
                Publicly available data consist of electrophysiological traces provided by contributing laboratories
                internal and external to the Human Brain Project (see Fig. 2).

            </div>
            <p>
                Contributed raw data files are in the Axon Binary Format (<span class="text-primary">.abf</span>) or the
                Igor Binary Format (<span class="text-primary">.ibw</span>) and have
                been converted to .json files and stored in a dedicated CSCS Object Storage container after insertion of
                relevant metadata (e.g. <em>cell_id</em>, <em>brain_region</em>, <em>brain_structure</em>,
                <em>stimulus_duration</em>, …) used for data
                processing and visualization. The data are read through the <span class="text-primary">Neo</span> and
                <span class="text-primary">Igorpy</span> Python packages and converted
                into value arrays before use.
                If you would like to contribute with your own data to the NFE, please send an email to <em>support AT
                    ebrains.eu.</em>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5><strong>User’s uploaded data</strong></h5>
            <p>
                Users can also upload and visualize their own data, which can be selected, for processing, independently
                or
                together with traces from the provided dataset.
                <br>For detailed information on the accepted data formats, please visit the NFE Guidebook dedicated
                <a href="https://hbp-bsp-hhnb.cineca.it/efelg/docs/file_formats/" target="_blank">

            <br>
            <h5><strong>Feature Extraction</strong></h5>
            <p>
                The feature extraction process precedes the generation of the <em>features.json</em> and
                <em>protocols.json</em>
                files, which are used for model parameter optimization performed through the <span
                    class="text-primary">BluePyOpt</span> software tool (please refer to the BluePyOpt <span
                    class="text-primary"></span>documentation</span> for detailed explanation) or for statistical
                analysis.
                The NFE is integrated in the
                <a href="https://hbp-bsp-hhnb.cineca.it/hh-neuron-builder/" target="_blank">
                    Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron Builder</a> web application that provides a point-and-click user
                friendly interface to guide the user through the entire optimization process.
                <br>The features that the user can select for extraction are described in the eFEL <span
                    class="text-primary">documentation</span> as well as
                the eFEL software package
                <a href="https://github.com/BlueBrain/eFEL" target="_blank">code</a>. See also the <span
                    class="text-primary">Hippocampal Neurons</span> dedicated page in the
                <a href="https://ebrains-cls-interactive.github.io/" target="_blank">EBRAINS Cellular Level
                    Simulation Interactive Workflows and Use Cases</a> guidebook.
                <br>Features are computed for every trace of the chosen recordings, where a trace corresponds to a given
                stimulus current amplitude (indicated to the user when data are displayed). Once the extraction is
                finalized,
                the values of a feature obtained from traces belonging to an individual cell and corresponding to the
                same
                stimulation amplitude are averaged. The averages computed for all the cells, are averaged a second time
                by
                stimulus amplitude. This will generate two result files (i.e. <em>features.json</em> and
                <em>protocols.json</em>) per cell
                plus
                two supplementary files with the global averages.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><strong>Graphical User Interface</strong></h4>
            <p>
                The GUI guides the user through the feature extraction process in a friendly way. The web application
                homepage shows a short tutorial on the usage of the interface.
                <br>The following is a description of the Feature Extraction process.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5><strong>Trace Selection</strong></h5>
            <p>
                Once the trace selection page is displayed, data can be filtered by choosing the following properties of
                the
                cell from five menu lists: 1) Contributor; 2) Species; 3) Brain structure; 4) Region; 5) Type; 6)
                Electrical
                type (<span class="text-primary">eType</span>). If any of the fields is missing (e.g. the eType of the
                cell
                is not known), the “unknown” label
                is displayed.
                <br>
                When the data are loaded, the traces contained in each file are shown and data files are grouped by cell
                id
                (see figure below). The user can select individual traces by clicking on the corresponding amplitude or
                (s)he can select/deselect all traces in a single file. Additionally, all files (and then all traces)
                referring to a single cell can be selected (see Fig. 3).
            </p>

                <img class="w-50" src="{% static 'efelg/img/efelg_traces.png' %}" alt="efel_traces" />
                <figcaption>Fig 3. - Voltage traces selection</figcaption>
            </div>
            <p>
                Alternatively, or concurrently, users can upload their own data (see <span class="text-primary">User’s
                    uploaded data</span>) by browsing their
                local storage and using the upload button (see figure below). The traces will be displayed for
                selection,
                together with the ones selected from the HBP dataset (if any).
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5><strong>Feature selection</strong></h5>
            <p>
                Once the trace selection approved, the feature selection page is displayed. Features are grouped by type
                -spike event features, spike shape features, voltage features- and can be selected individually or
                collectively through the select/deselect buttons. Given the high number of features, the three types are
                grouped in toggle boxes (see Fig. 4). Upon selection approval, the feature extraction process takes
                place
            </p>

            <h5><strong>Results</strong></h5>
            <p>
                Finally, a success message is displayed and results are made available to download. The application
                output consists of a <em>features.json</em> and <em>protocols.json</em> files which are generated for
                both individual
                cells and the entire ensemble. These files contain the feature value averages (computed as outlined in
                the above section “Feature Extraction”) and the protocols adopted for the experimental recordings. These
                files are intended to be used for the data-driven optimization step of the <a
